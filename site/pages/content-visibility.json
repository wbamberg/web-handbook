It enables the user agent to skip an element's rendering work (including layout and painting) until it is needed â€” which makes the initial page load much faster.","syntax-example":"/* Keyword values */\ncontent-visibility: visible;\ncontent-visibility: hidden;\ncontent-visibility: auto;\n\n/* Global values */\ncontent-visibility: inherit;\ncontent-visibility: initial;\ncontent-visibility: revert;\ncontent-visibility: revert-layer;\ncontent-visibility: unset;\n"}
